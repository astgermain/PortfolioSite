# Hello, This is a fully functional and scaleable MERN application (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).
## Some features include: Global state management with Redux, schema-based modeling for application data via Mongoose, authentication via JWT, passport, and more!

#Live : https://astgermain.me/

# Installing
## Fork/Clone the repo and run npm install in each main directory(frontend,backend)

# Starting the webapp with pm2
## Currently use the command pm2 start start.config.js to start the frontend and backend
## Backend can be located at port 4000, frontend at port 3000

# Running locally with npm
## The best way to do this is to open/split two terminals one pointing at backend and one at frontend/src and running the command npm start
